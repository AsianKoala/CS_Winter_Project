# CS_Winter_Project
-------------------
To play a working version go to releases and download the latest .jar.

I was bored over winter break and had a small assignment in CS (Foundations) so I 
made this pretty scuffed game. It took me about 24 hours worth of actual coding time to make it.


## very scuffed btw
