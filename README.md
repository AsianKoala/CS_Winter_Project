# CS_Winter_Project
-------------------

I was bored over winter break and had a small assignment in CS (Foundations) so I 
made this pretty scuffed game. To play a working version go to releases and download the latest .jar.
The earliest version of the game ofc will be in the project, so clone the repo and go to src\Main\Main to run 
the game. I try to keep the releases as new as possible but the game is broken a lot of the time & I don't work on this that much,
soooooooo
