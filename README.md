# CS_Winter_Project
-------------------
To play a working version go to releases and download the latest .jar.

I was bored over winter break and had a small assignment in CS (Foundations) so I 
made this pretty scuffed game. 

The earliest version of the game ofc will be in the project, so clone the repo and go to src\Main\Main to run 
the game. I try to keep the releases as new as possible but the game is broken a lot of the time & I don't work on this that much,
soooooooo
