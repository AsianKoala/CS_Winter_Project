# CS_Winter_Project
-------------------
To play a working version go to releases and download the latest .jar.

I was bored over winter break and had a small assignment in CS (Foundations) so I 
made this pretty scuffed game. It took me about 24 hours worth of actual coding time to make it.


# game controls (very scuffed btw)

- \- -> Decrease asteroid speed (Default 5)
- \+ -> Increase asteroid speed
- \[ -> Decrease asteroid generation (Default 700)
- ] -> Increase asteroid generation
- WASD -> Player translation controls
- Space -> Shoot in current direction
- Left click (dragging also works, flexible) -> Turn/Point in that direction
- Right click -> Point and shoot in that direction

# game rules

- You have 5 hearts
- Asteroids with tracking try to kill you
- You have to kill them with lasers before they touch you
- 60 seconds

# game objects

- Green triangle is the player, red line is the player direction
- Enemies are the red squares lol
